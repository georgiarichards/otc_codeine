# Sales of over-the-counter (OTC) codeine-containing products in 31 countries
This repository contains the code used for a study on the sales of over-the-counter codeine-containing products in 31 countries. We cannot openly share the data owing to contractual agreements with IQVIA, but the data can be accessed directly from IQVIA, which will require a fee.

We used Stata to clean and analyse the data and Python to create some figures, both sets of code are available in this repository.
